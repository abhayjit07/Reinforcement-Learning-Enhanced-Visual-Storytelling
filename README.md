# Reinforcement-Learning-Enhanced-Visual-Storytelling

## DATASET

For this project, we employ the Sequential Storytelling
Image Dataset (SSID), introduced by Z. M. Malakan, et al.
in their work on Visual Storytelling [12]. The dataset is a
collection of open-source video frames paired with story-like
annotations. Each sequence in SSID consists of five images,
with four distinct story annotations provided per sequence. The
images were manually selected from publicly available videos
across three domains: documentaries, lifestyle, and movies,
and were then annotated by human contributors via Amazon
Mechanical Turk. Overall, the SSID dataset contains 17,365
images, organized into 3,473 unique five-image sequences.
Each sequence has four corresponding ground-truth stories,
resulting in a total of 13,892 unique narrative annotations.
Each story comprises five sequentially connected sentences,
written to form a coherent narrative
